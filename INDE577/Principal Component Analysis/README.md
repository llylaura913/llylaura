# Principal Component Analysis

Principal component analysis (PCA) is a technique for reducing the dimensionality of such datasets, increasing interpretability but at the same time minimizing information loss.

### 1. Decorrelation

You observed in the previous exercise that the predictor and outcome measurements of the dataset are correlated. Now, you'll use PCA to decorrelate these measurements, then plot the decorrelated points and measure their Pearson correlation.

### 2. Intrinsic dimension

Intrinsic dimension:

    Intrinsic dimension = number of features needed to approximate the dataset

    Essential idea behind dimension reduction

    What is the most compact representation of the samples?

    Can be detected with PCA 

PCA identifies intrinsic dimension:

    Scatter plots work only if samples have 2 or 3 features

    PCA identifies intrinsic dimension when samples have any number of features

    Intrinsic dimension = number of PCA features with signficant variance
