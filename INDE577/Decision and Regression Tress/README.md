# Decision and Regression Tress

### Decision Trees: 

Decision Trees (DTs) are a non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression. The goal is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features. A tree can be seen as a piecewise constant approximation.

### Regression Tress: 

Decision trees can also be applied to regression problems, using the DecisionTreeRegressor class.

### Task:
    
1. constructing Decision Trees 
    dataset is from 'FEV.csv'

2. constructing Decision Trees:
    the dataset is created by myself: 
    x = np.array(list(range(1, 11))).reshape(-1, 1)
    y = np.array([4.50, 4.75, 4.91, 5.34, 5.80, 7.05, 7.90, 8.23, 8.70, 9.00]).ravel()


```python

```
