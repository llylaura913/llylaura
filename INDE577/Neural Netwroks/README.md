# Perceptron
A perceptron is a neural network unit (an artificial neuron) that does certain computations to detect features or business intelligence in the input data.

# Multi-Layer Perceptron

It has 3 layers including one hidden layer. If it has more than 1 hidden layer, it is called a deep ANN. An MLP is a typical example of a feedforward artificial neural network. In this figure, the ith activation unit in the lth layer is denoted as ai(l).



### Tasks:

1. implement Perceptron:
    
    obtaining weight
    
    

2. implement multi-layer Perceptron:
    
    obtaining MSE (lose)
    
    Sigmoid activation function: f(x) = 1 / (1 + e^(-x))
    
    Derivative of sigmoid: f'(x) = f(x) * (1 - f(x))
    
    training and testing 
    
    Plot the confusion matrix
