# K-Nearest Neighbors
The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a data classification method for estimating the likelihood that a data point will become a member of one group or another based on what group the data points nearest to it belong to.

### Programming languages:

1. Load the data

2. Choose K value

3. For each data point in the data:

4. Find the Euclidean distance to all training data samples


```python

```
