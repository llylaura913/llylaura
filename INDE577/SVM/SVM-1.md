# Support vector machines

Support vector machines (SVMs) are a set of supervised learning methods used for classification, regression and outliers detection. The advantages of support vector machines are: Effective in high dimensional spaces. Still effective in cases where number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples.

### Task:

1. building Linear Support Vector Machines

2. building Nonlinear Support Vector Machine - polynomial features 

3. polting the graphing 

### Datasets:
    The dataset for Linear SVM is from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs.   
    
    The dataset is created by myself. 


```python

```
